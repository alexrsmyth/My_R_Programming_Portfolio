install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins)

## find the mean bill length of penguins from each island group.

penguin %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summaraize(mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm))


# A tibble: 3 Ã— 2
  island    mean_bill_length_mm
